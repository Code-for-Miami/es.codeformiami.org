#Attribution and Thanks
From the Code for Miami code repo, special thanks to the following Code for Miami brigade members who saw this project to fruition. (Please see the collaborators link because it's not scalable to constantly update it, but now that it is greatly appreciated.) And you, if you plan on making improvements to this website!

From the original Code for Hampton Roads repo: This repo and the site codeforvirginiabeach.org uses Twitter Bootstrap and started from their [Carousel jumbotron](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/examples/carousel.html) template. They are awesome.

#Issues, Questions, Wana Help?
We take Pull Requests! See http://codeformiami.org for getting involved, and http://codeforamerica.org if outside Miami. Use github's issues if you see a problem or have a feature request. Other questions can be directed to Code for Miami captains Rebekkah Monson (Twitter: @rsm) or Ernie Hsiung (Twitter: @ErnieAtLYD).
